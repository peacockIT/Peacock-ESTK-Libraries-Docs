Copy the **Peacock ESTK Library** folder into one of the application folders as follows:

appData
~~~~~~~~

- Mac: ``/Library/Application Support/``
- Win: ``C:\ProgramData\``

  .. note:: The |The_Javascript_Tools_Guide| mentions that the appData path on windows is the value of %APPDATA% which is by default ``C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data``.
    However on my windows 10 machine the appData path was as displayed above ``C:\ProgramData\``

- Mac: ``~/Library/Application Support/``
- Win: ``~\AppData\Roaming\``

  .. note:: The |The_Javascript_Tools_Guide| mentions that the userData path on windows is the value of %USERDATA% which is by default ``C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data``.
    However on my windows 10 machine the appData path was as displayed above ``~\AppData\Roaming\``

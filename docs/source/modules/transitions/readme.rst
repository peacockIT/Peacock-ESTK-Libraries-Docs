Presets
~~~~~~~

Choose one of the following presets for the adsr settings.

  - Kick
  - Snare
  - Hihats
  - Bass
  - Piano
  - Pads
  - 1
  - 1/2
  - 1/3
  - 1/4
  - 1/6
  - 1/8
  - 1/12
  - 1/16

All the instrument presets represent fixed values for the adsr.

The quantized presets (1 ... 1/16) are getting updated each time the bpm
value of the script is changed. In order to use this update function you
need to make sure the checkbox ``Snap In Out Transition To Bpm`` is
checked in the ``Options`` tab.

This is how the values are getting distributed between a, d, s and r:
  .. code-block:: javascript

    a = beatRate / 3; d = beatRate / 3; r = beatRate / 3.5;

The r value is slightly smaller calculated in order to make it possible
to loop the adsr without intersections between r and the following a.

**The Main Window** first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power,
which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character,
and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven.
Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion.
Time is regarded as the basis of this motion.
Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.
